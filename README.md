# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my Github page! 

I am a fourth-year Computer Science student at the WrocÅ‚aw University of Science and Technology.
Currently I put my main focus on front-end technologies, especially React library. 

Besides programming, my main activities are cycling, running and good music.
