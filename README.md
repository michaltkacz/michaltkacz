# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is MichaÅ‚ and I welcome you to my Github page! 

I am a third-year Computer Science student at the WrocÅ‚aw University of Science and Technology.

I am interested in general computer software development; however, lately I am especially focused on front-end technologies - HTML/CSS/JS and React library. 

As a beginner in the IT industry, I am ready to take on new challenges that will allow me to develop my skills. Currently I am looking for a job in a software company.

Besides programming, my main interests are bikes and bass guitar.
